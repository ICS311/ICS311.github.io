<h2>Topic 22 Parallelism Exercise</h2>

<img src="Fig-27-2-P-Fib.jpg">

<p> Assuming 1 unit of work per vertex, and we have already determined
(previous exercise) that work <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> = 17 and span
<i>T</i><sub>&infin;</sub> = 8, then ... </p>

<p><b>Parallelism</b> <i>T</i><sub>1</sub> / <i>T</i><sub>&infin;</sub>=
17/8 = 2.125. </p> 

<p> We can evaluate the prospects for speedup for <tt>P-Fib(4)</tt>
(<i>n</i>=4) under the three perspectives: </p>

<ul>
   <li><i>Ratio </i>: at most 2.125 units of work can be done in each
   time unit of  parallel execution.</li> <br>
  <li><i>Upper Bound </i>: Given an infinite number of processors, we achieve
   speedup of at most 2.125.</li> <br> 
  <li><i>Limit</i>: Beyond 3 processors we don't get any more
   speedup (and the third processor does not add much). </li>
</ul>

<p> For example, with <i>P</i>=4 the <b>slackness</b> is
(<i>T</i><sub>1</sub> / <i>T</i><sub>&infin;</sub>)/<i>P</i> = 2.125/4
= 0.53125. This is less than 1 so we have more processors than we can
make use of. </p> 

<p> Note that these specific numbers are for <tt>P-Fib(4)</tt>
(<i>n</i>=4) <em>only</em>: further analysis would be needed for the
general case. How would the ratios change for higher <i>n</i>?
Consider this graph for <tt>P-Fib(6)</tt> </p>

<p>How is the span increasing? How are the number of vertices
increasing? Do you expect the paralleism to increase, decrease, or
stay the same for larger <i>n</i>?</p>

<p>The next section gives us a general way to analyze this.</p>
