<p>We can't just subtract 4 from 10 to get 6 because the resulting
graph would not model the possiblity that we choose to use only the
pipe from <i>v</i><sub>2</sub> to <i>v</i><sub>1</sub>. </p>

<p> The solution is to introduce fictional or virtual vertices that
break up one of each pair of anti-parallel edges. </p>
