<h3><a name="binarytrees">Quantitative Facts about Binary Trees</a> </h3>

<p>A <b>binary tree</b> is a finite set of vertices that is either empty or consists of a
vertex called the root, together with two binary subtrees that are disjoint from each other and from
the root and are called the <b>left</b> and <b>right subtrees</b>.</p>

<p>A <b>full binary tree </b> is a binary tree in which each node either is a leaf or has exactly
two nonempty descendants. In a full binary tree of height <i>h</i>:</p>

<ol>
  <li> # leaves = (# internal nodes) + 1.</li>
  <li> # leaves is at least <i>h</i>+1 <i>(first example figure)</i> and at most
       2<sup><i>h</i></sup>  <i>(second example figure)</i>.</li>
       <img src="Topic-08/diagram-tree-heights-wide.jpg" align="right" border="1">
  <li> # internal nodes is at least <i>h</i> <i>(first example)</i> and at most
       2<sup><i>h</i></sup>-1 <i>(second example)</i>.</li>
  <li> Total number of nodes (summing the last two results) is at least 2<i>h</i>+1 <i>(first
       example)</i> and at most 2<sup><i>h+1</i></sup>-1 <i>(second example)</i>.</li> 
  <li> Height <i>h</i> is at least lg(<i>n</i>+1)-1 <i>(second example)</i> and at most
       (<i>n</i>-1)/2 <i>(first example)</i></li>  
</ol> 

<p>A <b>complete binary tree </b> is full binary tree in which all leaves have the same depth and
all internal nodes have degree 2 <i>(e.g., second example above)</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>Note:</i> some earlier texts allow the last level of a "complete" tree to be incomplete!
They are defined as binary trees with leaves on at most two adjacent levels <i>l-1</i> and <i>l</i>
and in which the leaves at the bottommost level <i>l</i> lie in the leftmost positions of
<i>l</i>.)</p>
